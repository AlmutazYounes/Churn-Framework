Churn Prediction Framework
The Churn Prediction Framework is a machine learning tool designed to accept any kind of data with minimal changes required to the framework. It includes an AutoML capability and performs all preprocessing steps required to deal with churn prediction.

Getting Started
To get started with the Churn Prediction Framework, you will need to follow the steps below:

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using the following command:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your dataset: Your dataset should include the target variable (i.e., whether a customer has churned or not) and any features you wish to use to predict churn. The dataset can be in any format, such as CSV or Excel.

Configure the parameters: Open the config.yml file and configure the parameters according to your dataset.

Run the main.py script: Run the following command to start the AutoML process and train a model:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Evaluate the model: After the AutoML process is complete, the framework will output a trained model. You can use this model to make churn predictions on new data. Additionally, you can evaluate the performance of the model by running the evaluate_model.py script.
Configuration
The config.yml file contains the configuration parameters for the Churn Prediction Framework. You can customize these parameters according to your dataset. The following parameters can be configured:

dataset_path: The path to the dataset file.
target_variable: The name of the target variable in the dataset.
datetime_features: A list of column names in the dataset that contain datetime values.
categorical_features: A list of column names in the dataset that contain categorical values.
numeric_features: A list of column names in the dataset that contain numeric values.
scaler: The scaler to use for numeric feature scaling.
imputer: The imputer to use for missing value imputation.
model: The model to use for churn prediction.
